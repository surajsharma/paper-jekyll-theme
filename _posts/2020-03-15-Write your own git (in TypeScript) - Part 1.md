This quote about git had me inspired:

> The combination of core simplicity and powerful applications often makes thing[s] really hard to grasp, because of the mental jump required to derive the variety of applications from the **essential simplicity of the fundamental abstraction** (monads, anyone?)

It comes from a [tutorial](https://wyag.thb.lt/) on writing your own git in Python, and I decided to port it to TypeScript.

In this and coming posts, we will go through the tutorial and complete in 8 steps. The code, which is strongly typed to the greatest possible extent can be found [here](https://github.com/inversepolarity/Sustain).

The tutorial leaves the task of upgrading the resulting app "to a full-featured git library and CLI" to the reader, so we will try to take it a step further, if not all the way.

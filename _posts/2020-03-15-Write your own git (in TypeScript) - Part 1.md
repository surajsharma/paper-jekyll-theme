This quote about git had me inspired:

> The combination of core simplicity and powerful applications often makes thing really hard to grasp, because of the mental jump required to derive the variety of applications from the essential simplicity of the fundamental abstraction (monads, anyone?)

It comes from a tutorial on writing your own git in Python.

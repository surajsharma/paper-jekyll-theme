> When media images, policies and corporate standards tell someone that they are an outsider who needs to fit in in non-relevant ways, we’re establishing patterns of inequity and stress. We need to be clear about the job that needs to be done, the utility we’re seeking to create, but not erect irrelevant barriers, especially ones we can’t see without effort. - Seth Godin

The ongoing society-vs-individual strife that has come to be a symbolic thread running in parallel to the otherwise seemingly normal narrative of my life can be understood to a large extent by the quote above. Not only are these ‘patterns of inequity and stress’ taking a toll on my financial and mental health, they are also draining me of vitality, zest, and enthusiasm for life – inclinations I used to have in abundance.

But narratives are malleable, and highly receptive to shifts in perception, and while there is always a pluripotentiality available for each observer to twist and turn their perception to fit the narratives that surround them, the more honest amongst us tend to stick to only those options which sound, at least theoretically, rational.

But we are all experts in rationality these days, a virtue that affords us little by way of options to redefine, spin, or shift the narratives that surround us

So, because the readily available lens of an antagonistic and irksome tale of rebellion and tragedy is a perpetual temptation egging me to exploit it, I must choose to look the other way, for I would not be much of a contrarian if I didn't.

The story so far goes thus, it appears that I, just a poor bloke with a chip on his shoulder, attempted something rather foolish to end up under the ever watchful eye of the big brother, got highlighted, and ended up at the mercy of obsessing entities. 

Yes, so I took a healthy dose of narcissistic abuse, and am forever doomed to “walk on eggshells”, but lately, I've come to realise that even narcissism is just a label we give to transitory stuff that has happened all the time on the planet.

So, here then, is where I pick up a new lens, instead of seeing the society as dumb and blind, I choose to see myself as the fool who didn't know better, and society as a mechanism in the service of my enlightenment.

Looking from the other side, the narrative does not seem so antagonistic. Looking from the Society-for-the-individual lens, it appears that it is I who was so fast asleep, that I had to be brought to at least the half-waking state that all others were in.

Maybe it's a spin, probably to many of you it does not even make sense. But as Ghalib said, 

> 'दिल को खुश रखने को गालिब ये ख्‍याल अच्‍छा है'

(a nice thought to keep the heart happy aka whatever floats your boat aka delusion)

But then, there is this Urdu couplet I found that resonated, and seems to be true

> تیری محفل کا بھرم رکھتے ہیں سو جاتے ہیں> ورنہ یہ لوگ تو بیدار نظر آتے ہیں

translated roughly:

> these people are only pretending to be asleep, for your sake, 
otherwise, they look pretty woke

Essentially meaning, you're not the woke one, waking people up, You are the one asleep, slowly being awakened to reality. How about that?

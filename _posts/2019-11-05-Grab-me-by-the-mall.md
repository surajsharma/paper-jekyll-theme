A reviewer on one of Newcastle(Australia)/London-based house music producer Mall Grab's records wrote

Reading this left me a little perplexed, certainly lo-fi house music isn't everyone's cup, but 'horny grandma breathing through the phone' is a rather fitting description. I felt I should have cringed at reading it, but I didn't. The cognitive dissonance piqued my curiosity, clearly someone is wrong on the internet, but also right in an ironic way.

Named after "the wrong way to hold a skateboard", Mall Grab (Jason Alexander)'s music has been described as "mildly celestial" and "hella stoned", names (joy orbison,...) have been dropped in comparison. 


Look, I get it, the vegan lasagna that is lo-fi house can be tricky to navigate through both on and off the dance floor, but it is an aesthete's aural paradise and offers a fresh context in the hierarchy of sample-based electronic music.

A word-cloud of genres tagged to the 26 year old musician's work includes "leftfield", "deep-house", "drum-and-base" and even "disco" and "jungle". But genres, like sub-hierarchies and synecdoches, can confuse us. 

If we scan the hierarchy, Mall Grab is closer to Burial - a UK based garage producer best known as the brains behind "Untrue",

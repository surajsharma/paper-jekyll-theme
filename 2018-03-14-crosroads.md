One motif that repeated itself frequently in my life over the past few weeks was "crossroads", both the word itself, and as its meaning. I did find myself coming across them, metaphorically speaking, again and again, each reference to them surreptitiously sneaking in as if it was trying to tell me something.

I would have dismissed the frequency easily, had I not also felt that, in ways more than one, I was at a non-metaphorical, yet non-physical crossing in my life.

Roads diverged, and the [universe ascended](http://surajsharma.blogspot.in/2008/01/games-people-play.html) on me, confronting me with choices. Choices between fear and desire, between action and inaction, between fleeing or standing my ground, the choice of accepting who I am, as I am, or rejecting myself, it was all very confusing.

I did understand that rationality wasn't a rational enough way to decide which way to go, for these were not rational questions. These subtle, recurring motifs were mainly the culmination of a desire to break through the boundaries between myself and the world, and a fear of what would happen if I was successful.

In a thunderclap that resounded as these questions emerged from my predicaments, I felt scared and totally alone, emotionally anguished, embarassed, humiliated for being stripped naked and placed in a panopticon. Now the choice was, how do I react to this fright I had given myself?

Friends and family, themselves polarised by the surge of news and emotions about me, wouldn't be of much help. Answering existential questions are your own responsiblity. 

So I did.

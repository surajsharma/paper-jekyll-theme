| [Netra](http://netra.singularium.in/) - A multi-industry, context-aware, image/pdf-to-data ML engine created by [Singularium](http://netra.singularium.in/) needed a robust frontend, I joined the team and helped them flesh out a deliverable UI/UX within 3 months. A useful B2B tool for turning unstructred data to structured data, Netra has applications in Retail, Medicine, Catering and Education verticals, among others. Using the [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) library in a non-singleton manner for state management (sorry flux/redux), I was able to work with large images and lots of SVG annotations, while processing coordinates expressed in different coordinate systems over a REST API. The turnkey solution included authentication and OTP-based registration. An excel-like table within the app was made possible with the wonderful [jExcel](https://bossanova.uk/jexcel/v4/). | ![Watch the video](https://puu.sh/GAhkc/2a1da7e7c3.gif) **Stack**: React/Zustand, react-router, Styled-Components, jexcel, chakra-ui, rsuite |

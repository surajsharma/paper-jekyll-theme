| [Koshwapp](https://koshwapp.netlify.app/) - For their open-source federated archive of social media messages, Tattle needed a "Whatsapp Chat Ingester", something that can read the .zip file that whatsapp exports and parse it for individual messages. I finished building this in under a week with React (hooks), Styled-components, jszip, and the awesome [whatsapp-chat-parser](https://github.com/Pustur/whatsapp-chat-parser) library by [Loris Bettazza](https://lorisbettazza.com/) who helped me out with parts of the project. You can use it to select, delete, link and tag whatsapp messages, including images (and videos in the future).| ![Koshwapp](https://puu.sh/FWAqD/d2ef62a2d2.gif)

| [Crossword](https://github.com/surajsharma/Crossword) - A Simple Crossword puzzle in React. SVG interals. Inspired by [The Guardian crossword puzzle](https://github.com/zetter/react-crossword), and has all the same features, which include revealing individual words, revealing all words, verifying each/all words from the backend and color-coding correct/incorrect words. Here's a [video demo](https://youtu.be/TQP-IyItfXo).| ![Crossword](https://puu.sh/FWhmK/0017aac2fd.gif) |

| [Match-The-Following](https://codepen.io/surajs1/pen/mYXeWJ) - A match-the-following game written in [p5js](https://p5js.org). Later at [Socratease](socratease.in), this evolved into a purely React-based project using Atlassian's [React-Beautiful-DnD](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd). A similar implementation of this turned into a Classification puzzle for [Socratease](socratease.in), here, instead of matching columns, the user must drag the choices into appropriate "buckets". Features included a randomisded color-colding scheme which informs the user of the correct bucket where the item belongs. | ![Match The Following](https://puu.sh/EeRgk/34b003699b.png) ![Match The Following](https://puu.sh/FWhl6/6191c34142.gif) ![Classification](https://puu.sh/FWhlQ/c5e1e384a8.gif)|

Hi, I'm Suraj and I live in Mumbai, India. Thanks for visiting my site.

I'm financial journalist and write software when I have the time. I work for [Cogencis](http://cogencis.com), India's first financial date and news wire. You may, if you're so inclined, check out my <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/surajsharma21" data-network="LinkedIn" data-proofer-ignore>LinkedIn</a> for more details. 

You can download my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_HwcsMkhATmZnlic2ZzbmEzY1k/view?usp=sharing) and view a sample of my writing (as a journalist) [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_HwcsMkhATmZ1l4V29NdXdIRmc/view?usp=sharing). For more samples of my business-related writing, you can view my [muckrack profile](muckrack.com/surajsharma).

I'd love to hear your feedback on this site and my work.

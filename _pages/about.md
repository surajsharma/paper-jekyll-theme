Thank you for dropping by!

I'm a software developer based in Bengaluru who used to work as a financial journalist for [Cogencis](http://cogencis.com), India's first financial data and news wire. 

In my earlier lives, I was (in no particular order), a [poet](surajsharma.blogspot.in), a ghostwriter, a content strategist, a government clerk, a computer repair boy, a [music](http://thesilentballet.com/reviews/Tape_-_Revelationes.html) [reviewer](http://thesilentballet.com/reviews/Stephan_Mathieu_-_A_Static_Place.html) etc. Check out my profile on [LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/in/surajsharma21) for more professional details. 

You can also download my latest CV [here](http://bit.ly/2N4B4Zd), and for more samples of my business-related writing, you can view my [muckrack profile](http://www.muckrack.com/surajsharma).

As a card-carrying generalist, I believe in a world where letter openers and Swiss Army knives co-exist.

I'd love to hear your feedback on this site and my work.

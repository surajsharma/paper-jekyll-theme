Hello, thank you for dropping by!

I'm Suraj, a software developer based in India. 

In my earlier lives, I was (in no particular order), a business reporter, a [poet](surajsharma.blogspot.in), a [ghostwriter](https://amzn.to/2Bsgj1D), a content strategist, a government clerk, a [music](http://thesilentballet.com/reviews/Tape_-_Revelationes.html) [reviewer](http://thesilentballet.com/reviews/Stephan_Mathieu_-_A_Static_Place.html) etc. Check out my profile on [LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/in/surajsharma21) for more professional details. 

You can also view my latest CV [here](http://bit.ly/31oAvMw), and for more samples of my business-related writing, you can view my [muckrack profile](http://www.muckrack.com/surajsharma).

As a card-carrying generalist, I believe in a world where letter openers and Swiss Army knives co-exist.

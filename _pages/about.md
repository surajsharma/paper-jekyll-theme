Welcome to my page, thank you for dropping by!

I'm Suraj, a web developer based in India with a bunch of crazy ideas about where software can take us. Currently freelancing as a dev for startups across the country/world, building [Sustain](https://github.com/inversepolarity/Sustain), a git-like solution in my free time.

As a card-carrying generalist, I believe in a world where letter openers and Swiss Army knives co-exist. 

I'd love to hear your feedback on this site and my work, drop in a line at [suraj@evenzero.in](mailto:suraj@evenzero.in)

Thanks for dropping by!


I'm a [software developer](https://github.com/surajsharma) and a financial journalist handling technology, media, and telecom sectors for [Cogencis](http://cogencis.com), India's first financial data and news wire. You may check out my <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/surajsharma21" data-network="LinkedIn" data-proofer-ignore>LinkedIn</a> for more professional details. 

Download my latest CV [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hogSmmY5-KkkUTNaVcSvTYxzCUGEzXUj) and view a sample of my writing (as a journalist) [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_HwcsMkhATmZ1l4V29NdXdIRmc/view?usp=sharing). For more samples of my business-related writing, you can view my [muckrack profile](muckrack.com/surajsharma).

As a card-carrying generalist, I believe in a world where letter openers and Swiss Army knives co-exist, the latter may be more expensive and less useful, but they're portable and add diversity to the ecosystem of tools.

I'd love to hear your feedback on this site and my work.

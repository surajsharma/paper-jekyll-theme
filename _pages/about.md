Thanks for dropping by!

I'm a financial journalist and [software developer](https://github.com/surajsharma) handling technology, media, and telecom sectors for [Cogencis](http://cogencis.com), India's first financial data and news wire. 

In my earlier lives, I've been (in no particular order), a [poet](surajsharma.blogspot.in), an aspiring diplomat, a content strategist, a government clerk, a computer repair boy, a [music](http://thesilentballet.com/reviews/Tape_-_Revelationes.html) [reviewer](http://thesilentballet.com/reviews/Stephan_Mathieu_-_A_Static_Place.html) etcetera. Check out my profile on [LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/in/surajsharma21) for more professional details. 

You can also download my latest CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gx-i23VMyU45YXUnYt9E-dHiLubXKkKp/view?usp=sharing), and for more samples of my business-related writing, you can view my [muckrack profile](http://www.muckrack.com/surajsharma).

As a card-carrying generalist, I believe in a world where letter openers and Swiss Army knives co-exist.

I'd love to hear your feedback on this site and my work.
